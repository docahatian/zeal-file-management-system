TRAINING DELIVERY 
The delivery of training should adhere to the design of the curriculum. Delivery should be guided by the 10 basic principles of competency-based TVET.
•	The training is Based on curriculum developed from the competency standards;
•	Learning is modular in its structure;
•	Training delivery is individualized and self-paced;
•	Training is based on work that must be performed;
•	Training materials are directly related to the competency standards and the curriculum modules; 
•	Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to the industry required standards; 
•	Training is based both on and off-the-job components;
•	Allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current competencies;
•	Approved training programs are Nationally Accredited 
The competency-based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, both on and off-the-job as long as the learning is driven by the competency standards specified by the industry.
The following training modalities may be adopted when designing programs: 
•	The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus programs would contain both in-school and in-industry training of fieldwork components. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.
•	Modular/self-paced learning is a competency-based training modality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer just facilitates the training delivery.
•	Peer teaching/mentoring is training modality wherein fast learners are given the opportunity to assist the slow learners.
•	Supervised industry training or on-the-job training is an approach in training designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual experience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in the training regulations. 
•	Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the instructions occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same place. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, video or computer technologies.
NATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND CERTIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS
